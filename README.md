### 1️⃣ Developer Accounts — Your First Step

* 🔑 **Amazon Developer Account:** Essential for creating, testing, and deploying Alexa Skills.
* 🌐 **Third-Party Services:** Need APIs? Set up accounts on platforms like **Google Cloud** or **AWS** for smooth integration.

### 2️⃣ Tools & Frameworks — Your Developer Toolbox

* 💻 Pick a programming language supported by AWS Lambda — **Python** and **Node.js** are great picks!
* 🎛️ Use the **Alexa Developer Console** to design, test, and manage your skill’s voice interactions.

### 3️⃣ Configuration — Connect the Dots

* 🔧 Configure APIs or external services your skill depends on (e.g., Google Sheets API).
* 🎤 Define your skill’s interaction model — set up **intents**, **utterances**, and **slots** so Alexa understands user commands clearly.
* 🔗 Link your Lambda functions or backend properly to your Alexa Skill for smooth request handling and responses.
